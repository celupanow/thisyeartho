<!-- This is the HTML file for the dashboard. It's what the user will see when they sign in.
This will eventually be similar to the index page. 
If this is a regular user, they should be able to search for existing articles and also to
submit an article to the request table in the database. 
If this is an admin user, they should be able to search and add like a regular user, but they
should also be able to grade articles.
We should be able to make certain parts of this page appear depending on the user's status. -->
