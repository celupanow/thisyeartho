<!-- This is going to be the main page. If a user is not logged in, they should be able
to search the database for existing articles or add an article to the request table.
There should be a search box and a form to submit or maybe ask if they'd like to submit
if the search doesn't find anything. Possibly putting in the random button here.
There should also be a link at the top to take them to the sign in page and another link to
take them to the sign up page. 
If a user is logged in, we'll show them the dashboard page, which will have similar
functionality.-->
