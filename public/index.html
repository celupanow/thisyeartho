<!-- This is going to be the main page. If a user is not logged in, they should be able
to search the database for existing articles. We need to decide if a user that is not logged in
should be able to add articles. If not, then this will only need the search capability. Otherwise,
it will also need a form for article submission.
Possibly putting in the random button here.
There should also be a link at the top to take them to the sign in page and another link to
take them to the sign up page. 
If a user is logged in, we'll show them the dashboard page, which will have similar
functionality.-->
